The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Appropriation Bill in less than nine minutes, without any discussion in the House, paving the way for the Centre to spend over Rs 45 lakh crore in the next financial year. The proceedings of the House were conducted amid din, with PM Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh and other ministers in attendance, and opposition members shouting slogans of “Modi-Adani Bhai Bhai” while demanding a JPC on the Adani issue. At 6 pm, Speaker Om Birla took up various cut motions moved by members to Demands for Grants and put them to vote together. They were all disallowed by a voice vote. “In relation to Demands for Grants, several cut motions have been received. Due to lack of time, I consider all the proposals as presented,” Birla said. Opposition leaders also objected to the likely introduction and passage of the Finance Bill, which had been added to Thursday’s supplementary list of business hours before the House met to pass the Appropriation Bill. RSP’s N K Premachandran, who sought to ask a supplementary question was subsequently assured by Birla that the Finance Bill will be taken up on Friday. There are indications that Parliament will be adjourned sine die after that. Opposition MPs then stormed into the Well of the House to demand for a JPC on Adani and the Demands for Grants were passed through a voice vote without any discussion. According to the Budget papers, the total expenditure in 2023-24 is estimated at Rs 45 lakh crore, of which total capital expenditure has been pegged at Rs 10 lakh crore. During the current financial year ending March 31, 2023, the total expenditure has been estimated at Rs 41.8 lakh crore, which is more than the outlay of 2021-22 by Rs 3.9 lakh crore. Effective capital expenditure has been estimated at Rs 13.7 lakh crore in 2023-24, an increase of 30.1% over RE 2022-23.
