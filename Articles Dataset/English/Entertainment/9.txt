Taylor Swift announced Thursday that she’s giving Swifties a major surprise in the form of four new songs ahead of her tour kickoff. “In celebration of The Eras Tour I’m releasing 4 previously unreleased songs tonight at midnight,” she revealed on her Instagram Stories. The four tracks include rerecordings of Swift’s dual contributions to the 2012 soundtrack to The Hunger Games — “Eyes Open” and “Safe & Sound” featuring Joy Williams and John Paul White — as well as “If This Was a Movie (Taylor’s Version)” and never-before-heard song “All of the Girls You Loved Before.” Notably, the superstar’s rerecording of her Hunger Games collaboration with The Civil Wars marks the first time Williams and White have appeared on record together since the duo’s contentious 2014 breakup. “If This Was a Movie” was originally released as a bonus track on the deluxe version of Speak Now, perhaps lending credence to the rampant fan theories that the 2010 album will be the next rerecording Swift plans to drop following both Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and Red (Taylor’s Version) in 2021. The Eras Tour is set to begin Friday with back-to-back shows in Glendale, Arizona, which has temporarily been renamed Swift City in honor of Swift’s imminent arrival. Rachel Zegler told The Hollywood Reporter at Tuesday’s Shazam! Fury of the Gods premiere in Los Angeles that she wasn’t able to secure tickets to Swift’s tour and blamed the Ticketmaster snafu. “I got screwed by Ticketmaster, too, guys. Celebrities are just like us — no, I don’t have tickets,” the actress and Swift fan said. “I just want everybody who worked really hard to get those seats, to get them and get to see it. I will see her some other time.”
