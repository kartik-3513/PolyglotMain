Filmmaker Rakesh Roshan, known for directing films like Krrish, Khoon Bhari Maang, Koi Mil Gaya, among many others, recently revealed that his film Karan Arjun starring Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan originally had a different cast. On the sets of Indian Idol 13, Roshan revealed that Karan Arjun was initially titled Kainaat and starred Ajay Devgn instead of Salman Khan. In a clip shared by Sony TV, Rakesh said, “In Karan Arjun, Ajay Devgn was there in Salman’s role and at that time the film’s name was Kainaat, which had Shah Rukh and Ajay. For some reason, Ajay couldn’t do the film.” In Karan Arjun, Salman Khan played the role of Karan, while Shah Rukh played the role of Arjun. The story revolved around rebirth of two brothers, who get brutally murdered and come back to seek vengence in their next life. Rakesh Roshan’s last directorial was the 2013 film Krrish 3, starring Hrithik Roshan. The fourth part of the franchise is still in its preproduction stage. A few months ago, Hrithik Roshan confirmed that Krrish 4 has not been shelved, however, he said that the production was stuck on a small but important technicality. In an interview with Pinkvilla, Hrithik had said, “I think, we should all get together and send out a little prayer. Everything is set (about Krrish 4) but we are stuck on one little technicality. Hopefully, we will overcome that by year end. Krrish 4 is definitely in the pipeline and it will happen real soon.”
