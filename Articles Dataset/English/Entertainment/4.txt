Music composer MM Keeravani was recognised at the 95th Academy Awards, where he won an Oscar for the RRR song ‘Naatu Naatu’. But when he composed the song for SS Rajamouli’s magnum opus, he didn’t expect it to win any awards, let alone an Oscar. In a new interview with Galatta Plus, Keeravani said that ‘Naatu Naatu’ was not exceptional in terms of music, and was just a typical commercial song. But it gained worldwide recognition because of the way it was directed by Rajamouli and choreographed by Prem Rakshit. He said, “Naatu Naatu is a mass, dance song. Technically speaking or aesthetically speaking, you expect awards in various kinds of songs where you showcase your talent in terms of classical music, or great poetry, or some kind of intricately designed orchestration, but ‘Naatu Naatu’ is just a vast commercial, a fast beat number for which in my wildest dream I did not expect any award, forget Oscar. It is not an award song only.” In his opinion, the song became a hit because of its choreography and the way it narrated a small story within a movie. The composer added, “What made the song attention-worthy is the contribution of the director and the choreographer. It’s a scene by itself, a short story in itself, very unique dance steps which became viral, so all the credit goes to SS Rajamouli and Prem Rakshit.” Keeravani would also not like to be addressed as an ‘Oscar-winning’ music composer, as he thinks that it is a reductive view of his work. “Oscar is a big name, people want to add tags, ‘Oscar winner so and so’, ‘Oscar winner XYZ’, once ok, twice ok, but if you say it repeatedly, then that XYZ has got no value, only if he is an Oscar winner, he is valued,” he said. Keeravani’s ‘Naatu Naatu’ became the first Indian film song to win an Oscar. He was accompanied by lyricist Chandrabose as he lifted the trophy on stage, while Rajamouli, along with the film’s lead actors, Ram Charan and NTR Jr, cheered from the audience.
