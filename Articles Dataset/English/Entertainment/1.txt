Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt’s fantasy action-adventure film Brahmastra made a splash at the box office and captured audiences’ attention with its special effects, cameos, and performances. The work that went into bringing director Ayan Mukerji’s vision of Brahmastra to life was captured in a new VFX breakdown video, shared by visual effects house DNEG. Several sequences featuring Mouni Roy, Shah Rukh Khan, and Amitabh Bachchan were filmed in front of a blue screen. The finished product, which gave the audience a top-notch theatrical experience, was designed for the big screen. It was earlier reported that Brahmastra featured almost 4,500 VFX shots. The video also showed how Shah Rukh’s character was created entirely in computers for one shot, and how the final battle sequence combined in-camera footage shot on soundstages with digital environments. Fans took to the comments section and praised the brilliant VFX work that went into the film. One of the fans said, “For me, Brahmastra was truly a very magical and inspiring experience. I still can’t believe that an Indian movie pulled off a concept of this scale with such spectacular VFX.” Another said, “I am happy that I saw this movie in the theatre in 3D. It was so magical and wonderful. I am ready for more movies from Astraverse.” Talking about the film, Ayan had said, “Inspired by many movies that brought fantasy worlds to life, I envisioned creating the world of Brahmastra in a way that would challenge the limits of Indian cinema.”. The director had revealed that he plans to finish the second instalment the film quicker than the first, and wants it to be released by the end of 2025. While multiple sequels are planned, none has been officially announced yet.
