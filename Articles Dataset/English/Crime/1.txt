The city police crime branch arrested a conman impersonating a police officer while detecting a four-wheeler theft case. The conman has been identified as Sanjay alias Madam Sundarrao Poplaghat (33), a resident of Raut Nagar in Jalna district. He currently resides in Hirapur Shivar of Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav said that it was while detecting the four-wheeler theft stolen from MIDC Cidco, that they realised Poplaghat was impersonating a police officer. The car, which played a major role in this detection has been recovered. "Our team managed to detect the vehicle theft within 36 hours. During investigatuon, we also found a fake number plate, a police siren, amber light used by police vehicles, police officer’s cap, police stickers and a dummy pistol," Aghav said. According to the police, in addition to the four-wheeler, the crime branch has also recovered a two-wheeler he recently stole from the limits of Mukundwadi police station. To avoid any suspicion, the accused started pasting ‘POLICE’ stickers on the stolen vehicles, so that he could easily give a slip during any surprise checking. Preliminary probe has revealed that the accused has two cases of theft registered against him. "There is a strong possibility that he might have started cheating and robbing people on highways while posing as a police officer. We have tasked a team to ascertain the same," Aghav said. After arresting the accused on Sunday, he was handed over to MIDC Cidco police. They produced him before the court of law on Monday, following which he has been remanded to three days police custody. MIDC Cidco inspector Gautam Patare said that the accused is a habitual offender. "Our priority at the moment is to learn of his alleged involvement in other vehicle thefts as well as street crimes, which we suspect him of committing."
